# Coding a Fitness Tracker with Python

Following along with Dave Ebbelaar ([link to his channel](https://www.youtube.com/@daveebbelaar)) in coding a fitness tracker with Python. The fitness tracker is a proof of concept that Dave Ebbelaar did during his masters in artificial intelligence, using a gyroscope sensor on the wrist. The sensor recorded the acceleration in the x, y and z planes as well as the gyrscopic angular velocity. The participants involved performed a number of exercises using a barbell. 

The aim of the fitness tracker was to utilise a machine learning algorithm in order to correctly classify the exercise the participant was performing given only the accelerometer and gyroscope data.

The machine learning project is broken down into 7 parts as follows:

**Part 1** — Introduction, goal, quantified self, MetaMotion sensor, dataset <br>
**Part 2** — Converting raw data, reading CSV files, splitting data, cleaning <br>
**Part 3** — Visualizing data, plotting time series data <br>
**Part 4** — Outlier detection, Chauvenet’s criterion, local outlier factor <br>
**Part 5** — Feature engineering, frequency, low pass filter, PCA, clustering <br>
**Part 6** — Predictive modelling, Naive Bayes, SVMs, random forest, neural network <br>
**Part 7** — Counting repetitions, creating a custom algorithm <br>
