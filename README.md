# Coding a Fitness Tracker with Python

Following along with Dave Ebbelaar ([link to his channel](https://www.youtube.com/@daveebbelaar)) in coding a fitness tracker with Python 

You can find the youtube playlist here [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Y17yukoyy0sT2hoSQxn1TdV0J7-MX4K)

The machine learning project is broken down into 7 parts as follows:

**Part 1** — Introduction, goal, quantified self, MetaMotion sensor, dataset <br>
**Part 2** — Converting raw data, reading CSV files, splitting data, cleaning <br>
**Part 3** — Visualizing data, plotting time series data <br>
**Part 4** — Outlier detection, Chauvenet’s criterion, local outlier factor <br>
**Part 5** — Feature engineering, frequency, low pass filter, PCA, clustering <br>
**Part 6** — Predictive modelling, Naive Bayes, SVMs, random forest, neural network <br>
**Part 7** — Counting repetitions, creating a custom algorithm <br>

## Data Science Project Template

The data science project template used is from the Cookie Cutter Data Science GitHub repo

You can use this template to structure your Python data science projects [Cookie Cutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/).
